# WILY Acme editor

Written by Gary Capell

This is a re-implementation of the acme editor from Plan-9.
It is written in standard C and depends on X11.
It does not use any Plan-9 utilities, libraries, services, etc.

Acme is a particularly interesting and unique editor.
It is my opinion that it hasn't received the attention it deserves
because of its association and dependence on Plan-9.

Wily is about 80% where it needs to be.  I cloned it and fixed
a number of problems due to bit rot.  It now builds and runs fine.

Of course, now that X11 is fading, so too will wily unless someone
ports it to SDL.  I hope that happens.
